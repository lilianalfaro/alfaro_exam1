        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Lilian Alfaro, and I am currently a senior majoring in Management Information Systems at Georgia College & State University. I am set to graduate in December and am actively seeking internship or part-time job opportunities to gain practical experience in my field. I am enrolled in the MMIS double Bobcats program, which provides an excellent platform to enhance my skills and knowledge in management and information systems. Additionally, I hold the position of Vice President of GC Wit and serve as the Secretary of DSAB, where I am deeply involved in supporting and leading various initiatives within the university community.</p>

        <p>Originally from El Salvador and raised in Texas, I have a diverse cultural background that enriches my perspective. I am passionate about learning and thrive on helping others grow alongside me. As a dedicated mother of a lively 10-year-old daughter, I stay on my toes and find joy in balancing family life with my academic and professional aspirations. My personal experiences have instilled in me a strong sense of responsibility and an eagerness to contribute positively to both my professional and personal circles.</p>

        <p>Traveling is one of my greatest passions. My recent adventure took me to New Zealand through the study abroad program at GCSU, an experience that broadened my horizons and allowed me to immerse myself in a new culture. Each journey I undertake fuels my curiosity and desire to explore the world further. I look forward to future travels and the opportunities they will bring to learn and grow in new environments.</p>
